# Plates Calculator

## What is this?
I've different weight plates in my home gym. When I try to setup a barbell or dumbell targetting a certain weight, I usualy do CRAZY gym math to figure out which plates I should use!
Enter: Plates Calculator to the rescue!  
Using this CLI tool (CLI for now), all I have to do is enter my plates invetory and my barbell or dumbbell's weight, et voila! The tool will me which plates to use!

## Why I'm building this?
I'm learning Java and I don't like doing Gym Math!

## How to run this
You must have git (duh!) and Java installed on your machine before trying to execute the following commands.
1. Clone the repo using git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FadyGrAb/plates-calculator.git
```
2. Get into the `plates-calculator` directory
```bash
cd plates-calculator
```
3. Compile the code.
```bash
# This will put the classes in 'build' directory
javac -d ./build ./src/*.java
```
4. Run the code.
```bash
java -cp ./build PlatesCalculator
```
5. Follow the onscreen menus.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that I'm still learning Java! So, I'll keep improving this as I learn new stuff! :)
